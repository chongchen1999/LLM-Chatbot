Here is a short poem about the stars:

The stars up in the sky so bright,
A twinkling show, both day and night.
Like diamonds scattered far and wide,
Their beauty takes my breath inside.

In their celestial dance, I see,
A magic that's meant to be.
Guiding lights on life's winding way,
To lead me through each new day.

Oh, stars above, you shine so bold,
A constant reminder of stories untold.
May your sparkle light the path ahead,
And fill my heart with wonder and joy instead.
