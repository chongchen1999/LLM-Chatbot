Here is a short poem about the stars:

Across the velvet sky so bright,
A twinkling tapestry, pure delight.
Stars of gold and silver shine,
Guiding lights, a celestial sign.

Their gentle sparkle reaches me,
A reminder of eternity.
In their soft glow, I am free,
To dream, to hope, to simply be.

So let me gaze upon the night,
And find my way by starlight bright.
For in those diamonds up above,
I see a beauty that is pure love.
