Here is a short poem about the stars:

Across the velvet sky so bright,
The stars shine down with gentle light.
Like diamonds scattered far and wide,
Their twinkle whispers secrets inside.

In constellations, they align,
Guiding dreams and making hearts entwine.
A celestial show, so pure and true,
A reflection of all that's new.

Oh, starry night, how you delight,
With mysteries and magic in sight.
May your soft glow guide us along,
To the wonders that the universe has sung.
