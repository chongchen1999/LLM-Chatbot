Here is a short poem about the stars:

Across the velvet sky so bright,
A twinkling tapestry takes flight.
Stars shine like diamonds in the night,
Guiding dreams and hopes to take flight.

Their gentle sparkle fills the air,
As if the universe did care.
For in their light, we find our way,
Through the darkness of each passing day.

So let us gaze upon their glow,
And let our spirits start to flow.
For in the stars' celestial show,
We find a magic that will forever grow.
